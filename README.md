# WD-Club

Welcome to the WD-Club activity repository. This repository is structured for all sections and groups to contribute without conflicts. Please follow the instructions below when contributing to ensure everything is organized.

## Sections and Groups

- The repository is divided into three main sections:
  - **B1**: Section B1 (CSE)
  - **B2**: Section B2 (CSE)
  - **AIML**: AIML Section (CSE)

Each section contains four groups:

- **G1**: Group 1
- **G2**: Group 2
- **G3**: Group 3
- **G4**: Group 4

## How to Contribute

1. **Locate Your Section and Group**:

   - Navigate to the folder corresponding to your section (B1, B2, or AIML) and then to your group folder (G1, G2, G3, or G4).

   For example, if you are in Section B1, Group 2, navigate to:

```bash
    /B1/G2/
```

2. **Add Your Code**:

- Place your code files inside your group's folder. Be sure not to modify other group's files or folders.

- Use descriptive filenames to indicate the purpose of your code (e.g., `login_page.html`, `signup_form.js`, etc.).

3. **Pull Latest Changes**:

- Before pushing your changes, always pull the latest updates to avoid conflicts with others' work.

```bash
git pull origin main
```

4. **Commit and Push**:

- After adding your files and changes, stage your changes, commit with a meaningful message, and push them to the repository.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Added [your group] files"
git push origin main
```

5. **Check for Conflicts**:

- In case of any merge conflicts, resolve them carefully without overwriting others' work. If unsure, ask for help from your group or instructor.
